Betamax HTML5 Video Player

Usage:

    | var vidEl = document.getElementById('video1');
    | var b1 = new Betamax(vidEl);

    or

    | var b1 = new Betamax('video1');

The player is on a very early stage, so I won't even bother testing in any other
browser (I use Google Chrome). Do not use it in production code yet!

If you like to show Buscape ads around your videos, check our demo.
